title: Using inline-r with IHaskell
---

It's possible to use `inline-r` with IHaskell notebook in order to get
benefits of R without introducing much costs for interporability
between languages.

See the
[tutorial notebook](https://github.com/tweag/HaskellR/blob/master/IHaskell/examples/tutorial-ihaskell-inline-r.ipynb)
in the repository for a walkthrough.
